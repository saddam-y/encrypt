# Encryption Examples

Encryption is a very interesting science for me.
I try to read more books and articles about it.
I will add some examples to better understand the individual parts.

##  Diffieâ€“Hellman protocol

I was surprised when I met this approach to cryptography.
It's so simple, but effective.

Yes, of course, my example is unsafe, I'm just trying this protocol. I hope to delve into this later

I used the pattern Strategy in UserCarefulImpl to configure the cryptostrategy. It is necessary comply with open/closed principle (**SOLID**)
I also did everything in accordance with the principle of dependency inversion principle (**SOLID**), for example, for example, in DiffieHellmanCrypto class (field randomMaster).
